## Description
This repository contains all laboratory activities completed for the course COSC 111.
Each activity is organized into a separate folder and includes the Arduino code,
breadboard diagram, and a README file explaining the activity and implementation.

## Laboratory Activities

1. [Laboratory Activity #1: Working with Digital Signals](Laboratory-Activity-1-Working-with-Digital-Signals)  
   Introduction to digital input and output using Arduino, focusing on basic HIGH and LOW signals.

2. [Laboratory Activity #2: Working with Analog Signals](Laboratory-Activity-2-Working-with-Analog-Signals)  
   Demonstrates analog input and output using sensors and PWM techniques on Arduino.

3. [Laboratory Activity #3: Working with Sensors](Laboratory-Activity-3-Working-with-Sensors)  
   Covers interfacing different sensors with Arduino and reading sensor data.

4. [Laboratory Activity #4: Arduino Serial Connection](Laboratory-Activity-4-Arduino-Serial-Connection)  
   Introduces serial communication between Arduino and a computer using the Serial Monitor.

5. [Laboratory Activity #5: Receiving Serial Connection using Arduino from Python](Laboratory-Activity-5-Arduino-Python-Serial)  
   Demonstrates receiving data sent from a Python program to Arduino via serial communication.

6. [Laboratory Activity #6: Bidirectional Control using Arduino and Python](Laboratory-Activity-6-Bidirectional-Control-Arduino-Python)  
   Implements two-way communication between Arduino and Python for device control.

7. [Laboratory Activity #7: Controlling Arduino using FastAPI](Laboratory-Activity-7-Arduino-FastAPI)  
   Uses FastAPI to control Arduino hardware through a web-based API.
